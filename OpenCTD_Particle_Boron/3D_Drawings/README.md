Originally from OpenCTD's 3D_Printer_Files_qduino directory.

I modified OpenCTD_2in in SolidWorks to "plug" two of the three temperature sensor holes as we're using only one T sensor. The new part is named OpenCTD_2in_singleTemp.

I modified OpenCTD_2in_singleTemp to open up the tolerances of each of the pressure, temp, and cond sensor ports. The new part is named OpenCTD_2in_singleTemp_redesign and this is what we intend to deploy.
